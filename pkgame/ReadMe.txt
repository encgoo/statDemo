1. Introduction

This is a demo javascript project for students of BU METCS546 to get
hand-on experience for using statistics in computer programming.
If you know a little bit of javascript and you should be able 
to participate. And this demo project is designed for easy participation.

In this project, we want to use statistics to compute probability 
for a possible score of the player, given the cards shown on the 
table. For simplicity, 4 cards for the player are shown. So the 
probability depends on the last card. 

2. How to run

Once you pull the whole project from github, start your browser, and open
the game.html file. 

3. How to participate

In the javascript folder, there is file called diy.js. You can modify that file
following the instruction there. That is the only file you need to modify. Once 
you modify and save that file, refresh the game.html from your browser, and you 
will see the result shown in the last row of the Table of Probabilities.
